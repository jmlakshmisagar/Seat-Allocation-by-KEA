## Description
This project is a seat allocation system that assigns seats to students based on their rank, preferred college, category, and priority according to Karnataka Examination Authority (KEA) rules, streamlining the process based on merit.

## Overview
The **Seat Allocation System** for KEA aims to provide a transparent process for assigning college seats to students, particularly for the MCA course. The system uses key parameters like student rank, college preferences, category status, and seat availability for allocation.

### Key Features:

1. **Merit-Based Allocation:** 
   - Operates on a First Come First Serve basis, prioritizing students with higher ranks.

2. **Multi-Factor Evaluation:** 
   - Evaluates rank, category (e.g., 1AG, 2AG, GM), and college preferences during allocation.

3. **Data Management:** 
   - Requires comprehensive data from students (personal details, rank, category, preferred colleges) and colleges (names, IDs, available courses).

4. **Step-by-Step Allocation Process:** 
   - Involves multiple rounds of seat filling based on candidate priority and eligibility.

5. **Outcome Documentation:** 
   - Generates reports on allocated seats and cutoff lists for each category.

### Performance Insights (2023 Data):
- **15,622** candidates appeared for the exam, with **7,144** MCA seats available.
- **1st Round:** 4,450 admitted.
- **2nd Round:** 380 admitted.
- **Final Round:** 136 admitted.
- Total seats allocated: **4,966**.

### Conclusion
This KEA seat allocation system streamlines the admission process while ensuring fairness and transparency, balancing merit with category reservations.
